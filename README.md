# smallTkinterGames


These are just two basic tkinter games, in case you are getting started with tkinter and want some inspiration.

Please note, I am an Austrian developer who codes with german variable names and german comments. Before publishing my work I tried to rename everything, so that it makes sense in English, but I can't promise that I didn't miss anything.

Cheers Tobias
